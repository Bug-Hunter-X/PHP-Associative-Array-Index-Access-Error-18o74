# PHP Associative Array Index Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to accessing associative arrays using numeric indices.  PHP arrays, while appearing similar to lists or dictionaries in other languages, behave differently when you try to access elements based on their numerical position rather than their keys.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code that throws a notice because of unexpected behavior of array index access.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version, emphasizing the proper use of keys for associative arrays. This is important for robust and error-free PHP code.
